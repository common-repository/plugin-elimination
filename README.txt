Great tool for quickly testing for plugin compatibility issues.

Click the `Save All Active Plugins` button to backup all active plugins. Then check to see if the errors you are
experiencing still exist. Then quickly turn them all back on before anyone is the wiser. You can even refresh the plugin
page (I know.. you did it on accident) without losing which plugins you deactivated.
